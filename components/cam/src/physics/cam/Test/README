To play with the test

1. Edit ener_config.cpp.in to change the following if you 
   do not want the default values

   * the tolerance of relative energy error: TOL
   * chunk index: BCHNK ECHNK
   * time step index: STEP
   * number of grid columns: PCOLS
   * number of vertical layers: PLEV

   Note: make sure you have an ASCII file 
   nstep_xxxxx_chunk_yyyyy_state.asc
   in this directory that contains the model 
   state variables needed for the test.

   *  xxxxx is the time step index (e.g., 00005);
   *  The number of vertical layers should match PLEV;
   *  The number of grid columns (in the .asc file) 
      should be no fewer than PCOLS.


2. Compile the test by typing
    $> make

3. Run the test by typing
    $> ./etest

4. If anything has been modified in ener_config.cpp.in, do
    $> make clean
   first before compiling again.
